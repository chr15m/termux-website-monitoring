Simple website monitoring using Termux and Android.

 * Install [Termux and Termux Boot](https://termux.com/) from Google Play or F-Droid.
 * Get [SSH access working](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access#Using_the_SSH_server) so you have remote access to your phone.
 * Edit the file `[monitor.sh](./monitor.sh)` in this repo and change the `SITE` variable to your site.
 * Copy it to your phone and install in `.termux/boot/monitor.sh` so it starts at boot.
 * Reboot your phone and you should see the icon of it running.
